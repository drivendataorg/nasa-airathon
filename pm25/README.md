# NASA Airathon: Predict Air Quality - Particulate Track

## Goal of the Competition
The goal of this track of the competition was to use remote sensing data and other geospatial data sources to develop models for estimating daily levels of PM2.5 with high spatial resolution. Successful models could provide critical data to help the public take action to reduce their exposure to air pollution.

## What's in this Repository

This repository contains code from winning competitors in the [NASA Airathon: Predict Air Quality - Particulate Track](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/88/competition-air-quality-pm/) DrivenData challenge.

**Winning code for other DrivenData competitions is available in the [competition-winners repository](https://github.com/drivendataorg/competition-winners).**
